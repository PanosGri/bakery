          <div id="historytext">    Our story goes back when our father met our mother...or his mother in law...or actually when he met his mother...or.. whatever..
        <p>Our father respected bread since he was from a poor family. He found his own way in life but he always had that incomplete dream. To make a bakery where he would be able to supply whoever wanted this precious godgiven gift...Bread.</p>
        The smell of the fresh sordough bread that our grandmother used to make every Sunday in the wood-fired oven was something that we adored.And when our father shared his dream we couldn't but support him with all means.<p>
              And here we are now after being settled for more than 10 years supplying a big number of restaurants even chain supermarkets with our products and being present every second day to all of the villages of Mani peninsula up to 50 kms away with our vans for the local community, feeling proud for our love for this holly gift...<br>
